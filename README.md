# Introduction
This is an Unofficial API of the website https://thispersondoesnotexist.com. it generates a random person picture using AI.
Everytime you open the page a new image is generated. I just made a code to return the image in byte.


#Requirements

* Java 17

## Example
### Use the API
Once you start the application, you can call the link below to get a new image.

````xml
    http://localhost:8086/generate
````

You have to process the byte[] and save the image in jpeg.
